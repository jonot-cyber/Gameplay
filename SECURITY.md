### Reporting a Vulnerability
When reporting a vulnerability, it is a major security issue for our live server, Cepi.
In that case, there are secure steps you can take if you find one.
If the security issue is severe, contact any main developer/admin of Cepi with either their discord name#tag or their email (if they provided one).
If you have a solution to the bug, it is safe to post it as a pull request, and we will accept it ASAP.
