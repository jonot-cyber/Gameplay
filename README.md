## Prerequisites

We recommend using the Eclipse or Intellij IDE. Make a personal folder.

## Installation
In a folder, run `git clone https://github.com/LeoDog896/Cepi.git`.
Once you do this, you can use any of our projects via importing them directly in your preferred IDE.

To use the folder `cepi-resourcepack`, you can import it into your `.minecraft` resource pack folder. To build and export it, you can ZIP it up.


## API
Coming soon!
